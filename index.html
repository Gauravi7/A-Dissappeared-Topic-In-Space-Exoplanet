                    An exoplanet is a planet located outside of our Solar System. The study of exoplanets is crucial, especially in finding planets similar to Earth that might host life.

Key Facts and Summary
The first possible evidence of an exoplanet was noted in 1917 but was not recognized as such.<br>
 The first exoplanet detected was Gamma Cephei Ab in 1998. It was not confirmed until 2003 though, and generally, it is believed that the two planets<br> orbiting the pulsar PSR 1257+12 are the first confirmed discovery. The discovery was announced in 1992.<br>
The first planet discovered orbiting around a Sun-like star was 51 Pegasi b.<br>
In respects to a planet similar to Earth, the first was discovered in 2014 named Kepler 186f. It is also located in the habitable zone of its star.<br>
The habitable zone is a region around a star where liquid water could exist on the surface of a solid planet.<br>
All the known exoplanets fall into categories depending upon their size, mass and orbital positions.<br>
                    The closest star system and closest planetary system to the solar system is at 4.37 light-years away. It is named the Alpha Centauri system.<br>
                    If life is discovered on other planets, then the panspermia hypothesis would greatly become more likely the answer on how life on Earth was established.<br>
                    There are over 4.000 exoplanets that have already been confirmed.<br>
                    Almost 5.000 other exoplanets are candidates waiting to be approved.<br>
Over 3.000 planetary systems have been discovered.<br>
About 700 systems have more than one planet.<br>
There are about 5 methods used for the detection of exoplanets. A sixth one has been implemented recently.<br>
In 2009 NASA launched a spacecraft named Kepler, specifically to look for and detect exoplanets.<br>
Among exoplanets, rogue planets have also been detected. They are planets that have been pushed out of their star system.<br><br>
                    The question of whether or not we are alone in the universe, or if there are other places such as Earth, may have well begun since our world has been mapped, and mostly explored. The first possible evidence of an exoplanet was noted in 1917, but it was quickly dismissed.<br>
                    As technology progressed, many other possible discoveries of exoplanets were proposed as early as 1988 but were only later confirmed. In 1992 the first detection of an exoplanet was finally confirmed. The radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the pulsar PSR 1257+12.<br>
                    Ever since then, the discovery of exoplanets became somewhat of a priority, and naturally, a great interest to humanity. Technology progressed and new methods of detection were implemented specifically for this task.
                    Did you know?<br>
More than 22% of Sun-like stars have Earth-sized planets in their habitable zone.<br>
There is at least one planet on average per star with about 1 in 5 Sun-liked stars having an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone.<br>
There could be about 1 trillion exoplanets in the Milky Way.<br>
At least one exoplanet has been discovered to have an exomoon. It was discovered in 2013 orbiting the Kepler-1625b exoplanet.<br>
Several exoplanets have been discovered to have atmospheres. The first to be observed was HD 209458 b in 2001.<br>
There is an exoplanet that has a tail like a comet. KIC 12557548b is an exoplanet very close to its star, and because of this, it leaves a trail of cloud and dust.<br>
Rogue planets are everywhere, and it is theorized that there could be 2 rogue planets per star in the whole universe.<br>
                    K2-18 b is probably the best candidate for habitability presently known.<br>
The first picture that was ever taken of an exoplanet happened in 2004. 2M1207b is a planet with five times the mass of Jupiter.<br>
The easest type of exoplanets to find are hot Jupiter’s since they’re massive and fast, making their signal easier to detect.<br>
The smallest exoplanet that has been found is named Kepler-37b. It is smaller than Mercury.<br>
It is quite possible that there are more planets in the universe than stars.<br>
Exoplanets orbit any kind of star.<br>
